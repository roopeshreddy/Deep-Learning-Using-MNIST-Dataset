# Deep-Learning-Using-MNIST-Dataset

>Using the MNIST dataset for digit classification.

>Building a simple neural network using TensorFlow.

>Include at least one hidden layer with an appropriate activation function.

>Train the network on the MNIST dataset.

>Monitor the training process and visualize the loss curve.

>Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on a test set.

>Display a confusion matrix or accuracy score.

>Visualize some of the correctly and incorrectly classified images
